# Decision trees, Random forests and Gradient boosting for cancer type classification

This repository contains the Python code and Jupyter notebooks, of the Decision tree, Random forest and Gradient classifiers as described in the project report as part of the final project <a href="https://github.com/Michael-Cornelisse/Datamining-project" target="_blank">project</a> of the course introduction to Datamining 2020 given at Radboud university.

In this project we have evaluated the performance of three different algorithms in a classification task on gene expression data to correctly classify the correct  cancer cell types acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) . Our initial hypotheses predicted that the Gradient boosting classifier would outperform the Random forest and Decision tree algorithms. This hypothesis turned out to be false with the Random forest being the best performing algorithm with a accuracy of 0.853, followed by Gradient Boost with an accuracy of  0.823 .The standard decision tree scores the lowest with an accuracy of 0.794

The data comes from the [Gene expression dataset (Golub et al.)](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/gene-expression.))[1].
